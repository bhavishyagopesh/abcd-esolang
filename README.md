# abcd-esolang
A modified esolang made for Chaos '16 - Techkriti IIT Kanpur

*NOTE* This language mostly based on another Esolang whose name would be revealed once the contest is over.
Credits where they're due.

# So how to begin?
If you use git, you know what to do. Otherwise, go here:
[https://github.com/sakshamsharma/abcd-esolang/archive/master.zip].
This should download this folder as a .zip file. Extract it

# Linux
`cd abcd-esolang` (or whatever the name of the file is)
`g++ abcd.cpp -o abcd`

You should now write your programs in files and run them as follows:

Assuming your program is in the same folder as the one above.
```
./abcd <program.ab>
```

You can also add abcd to your path using the following command:

```
echo "PATH=/home/<youruser>/abcd-esolang/:$PATH" > ~/.bashrc
```

Of course, you need to replace <youruser> with your username, and adjust the path appropriately.
